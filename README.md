## Structure

Each subdirectory contains a README and Python scripts illustrating key concepts and algorithms. Example code uses `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and other scientific libraries.

## Getting Started

To run the example scripts, ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

Then run any script, for example:

```bash
python root-finding/newton_raphson_example.py
```
